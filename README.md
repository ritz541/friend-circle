"ðŸŒŸ Friends' Hub: A Colorful Personal Website ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to Friends' Hub, a vibrant and interactive website crafted for my friends and classmates. Using HTML and CSS, I've created a space where each friend's name is showcased as a colorful button. When clicked, these buttons lead to their respective Instagram profiles, fostering a sense of connection and easy navigation.

âœ¨ Features:

Colorful buttons for friends' names
Direct links to individual Instagram profiles
'Contact Me' button for updates and feedback
Option to add your name and join the hub
Join the community, explore, and stay connected with our unique web destination! Let's keep the bonds strong and the colors vibrant. ðŸŽ¨ðŸš€"
